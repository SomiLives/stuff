2024-12-23 12:36:10,352 - Query:  HOW TO PROCESS AN AEDO DEBIT ORDER TRANSACTION?
Response: The instructions provided in the context are for processing an AEDO debit order transaction on a Bluebird MT280 mobile terminal. To process the transaction, follow these steps:

STEP 1: INSERT OR SWIPE THE CUSTOMER/CLIENT’S CARD ON THE TERMINAL (SEE FIG 1)
Insert the card with the chip facing forward or swipe it with the magnetic reader facing the keypad.

STEP 2: SELECT THE ACCOUNT TYPE UNDER THE CHOOSE PAYMENT MENU (IE. CHEQUE/SAVINGS), SEE FIG 2.
Choose the payment option based on the account type.

STEP 3: SELECT DEBIT ORDERS UNDER THE TRANSACTION MENU, SEE FIG 3.
Select the debit order option from the transaction menu.

STEP 4: SELECT BILL PURCHASE UNDER THE AEDO MENU, SEE FIG 4.
Select the bill purchase option from the AEDO menu.

STEP 5: ENTER THE ACCOUNT NUMBER, SEE FIG 5.
Enter the account number as prompted on the terminal.

STEP 6: TWO (2) SLIPS WILL PRINT OUT OF THE TERMINAL, THE FIRST SLIP IS THE MERCHANT’S COPY AND THE SECOND SLIP IS THE CUSTOMER/CLIENT’S COPY.
The transaction is completed and two slips will print out of the terminal, one for the merchant and one for the customer/client.

To process an AEDO debit order transaction, follow these steps:

1. Insert or swipe the customer/client's card on the terminal.
2. Select the account type from the payment menu.
3. Choose the debit order option from the transaction menu.
4. Enter the account number as prompted on the terminal.
5. The transaction is completed, and two slips will print out of the terminal.

Note: The instructions provided in the context are for processing an AEDO debit order transaction on a Bluebird MT280 mobile terminal. The steps may vary slightly depending on the specific terminal being used.
